How It Works

Scraping Process
URL Request: The program fetches the webpage using the requests library.

Data Parsing: The BeautifulSoup library extracts quotes and authors from the HTML content of the page.

Saving Data
CSV Writing: Scraped data is saved in a CSV file with columns for quotes and authors.

Appends Data: Each new run adds data to the existing CSV file instead of overwriting it.

Scheduling Tasks
Automation with Schedule: The schedule library is used to run the scraping function at specified intervals (e.g., every minute).

Infinite Loop: A continuous loop ensures that scheduled tasks execute on time.

Why This Application Stands Out Automated Data Collection Eliminate manual scraping by automating the process with a scheduler.

Organized Data Storage Keep all collected quotes in a structured and reusable CSV format.

Simple and Scalable Easily modify the scraping interval or expand functionality to include more data fields or websites.
